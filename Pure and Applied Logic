Program
The Pure and Applied Logic (PAL) program at Carnegie Mellon University is an interdisciplinary affiliation of Ph.D. programs 
in three constituent departments:
the Computer Science Department in the School of Computer Science
the Department of Mathematical Sciences in the Mellon College of Science
the Department of Philosophy in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences
Students who are interested in logic apply to and are admitted by the individual departments.

The program builds upon Carnegie Mellon's unique strengths in logic and its applications to computer science. 
Internationally recognized faculty, frequent workshops, colloquia, seminar series, and excellent computing facilities 
contribute to an ideal environment for both theoretical and applied research. Graduates of the program have gone on to 
prominent positions in industry and academe.

Areas of strength include:

automated theorem proving
category theory and categorical logic
constructive mathematics
formal verification
foundations of decision theory
foundations of programming languages
homotopy type theory
logics of programs
logic in linguistics
lambda calculus
learning theory
model theory
proof theory
set theory
temporal and modal logics
theory of computing
type theory

Related research at Carnegie Mellon includes algorithms, artificial intelligence, combinatorial optimization, 
computational complexity, computational linguistics, operations research, and programming systems.

Logic course offerings
