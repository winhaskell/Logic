 "The theory of types brings in a new idea for the solution of paradoxes, especially suited to their intentional form. 
 It consists in blaming the paradoxes not on the axioms that every propositional function defines a concept or class, 
 but on the assumption that every concept gives a meaningful proposition, if asserted for any arbitrary object or objects as arguments"
 —— K. Gödel
