About the ILLC
What are the mathematical properties of information? How can we describe how information flows between humans or computers? 
Questions such as these lie at the heart of the research conducted at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC), 
a world-class research institute in the interdisciplinary area between mathematics, linguistics, computer science, philosophy 
and artificial intelligence, which is rooted in the Amsterdam logic research tradition dating back to the early twentieth century.

The ILLC is staffed by faculty members of the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Amsterdam.
Its research is concentrated in three core programmes:

Logic and Computation
Logic and Language
Language and Computation
These three programmes are united by two Key Themes: Logic and Game Theory and Cognitive Modelling.

The ILLC coordinates the Graduate programme in Logic (Master and PhD) and members of the ILLC teach in a wide variety of 
study programmes. See here for more information.

ILLC members are involved in a high number of externally funded projects (especially NWO funded projects). 
Currently ILLC hosts 2 VICI grants, 4 VIDI grants, 6 VENI grants and a number of other projects (Eurocores, Free competition, Mosaic).
